          Andres Soriano College was founded in 1951 as a consequence of the
          tenacious efforts of people who thought that children should be
          developed holistically. Situated in Mangagoy, the college sought to
          meet the educational needs of the expanding populace, which included
          laborers from businesses like PICOP and BBLCI. With the support of
          committed civic-minded people like Mr. Godofredo M. Manila and Mr.
          Marcelo Ligas, Andres Soriano College got its start in a modest
          13-room nipa building, housing hundreds of eager learners. The college
          was founded on the principles of faith and a dedication to offering a
          top-notch education. The Board of Trustees and the administrative team
          put up a lot of effort to make sure the school fulfilled the
          requirements set by the Department of Education.

          The professors, who are the center of the institution, were
          instrumental in forming the school's character. The goal of the
          faculty screening procedure was to choose teachers who were committed
          to the institution's mission of fostering moral and spiritual
          qualities in their pupils. Andres Soriano College aspired to be more
          than just a place of higher learning; it also wanted to better the
          community and serve the needs and interests of its people.

          After Andres Soriano College was given the all-clear to open for
          business in 1952, courses began on June 12 with 139 students enrolled.
          Being the first department of its kind and the college's main source
          of funding, the establishment of the day high school department was
          very noteworthy. The school's main goals were to instill in the
          students a feeling of moral responsibility and to fight illiteracy by
          offering a top-notch education. Eventually, the students were expected
          to become law-abiding, admirable citizens. The thriving Paper Mill
          industry contributed to a notable enrollment boom at Andres Soriano
          College in the exciting 1980s. The number of students flocked to our
          institution increased year after year as the labor force grew. The
          enrollment figures peaked in 1979&mdash;1980 with an astounding gain
          of 397 students, representing a growth of 17.92% in just ten straight
          school years. The ASC suffered comparable challenges to those that the
          PICOP faced. Enrollment dropped by a startling 25.60% as a result of
          teacher layoffs and financial difficulties that prevented many
          students from completing their education. Still, the committed
          instructors of Andres Soriano College persisted, emphasizing the need
          of teaching moral principles in their students.

          On July 19, 2014, tragedy struck ASCB as the institute faced a
          devastating fire. The destruction engulfed most of the school, sparing
          only the open gym and elementary building but ASCB remained steadfast
          in its commitment to providing education towards students. Despite the
          challenges posed by the current state, makeshift classrooms have been
          set up to ensure continuity in learning.

          Through faith and resilience, ASCB rose again from the ashes. It
          embarked on a journey of rebuilding, introducing new structures such
          as the JHS building and the Old Building. Later, the completion of the
          new three-storey building marked a significant milestone in the
          institute&apos;s revival.
