            The
            <strong> Andres Soriano College of Bislig </strong>
            was founded in 1951 as a consequence of the tenacious efforts of
            people who thought that children should be developed holistically.
            The college, which was situated in Mangagoy, was established to meet
            the educational requirements of the expanding populace, which
            included workers from businesses like PICOP and BBLCI. Under the
            direction of committed civic-minded people like Mr. Godofredo M.
            Manila and Mr. Marcelo Ligas, Andres Soriano College started out as
            a modest 13-room nipa building that could house hundreds of eager
            students.
